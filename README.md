# Local-Area-Network-Configuration

**Overview**

This project demonstrates how switches and routers are configured in a Cisco networking environment using the Router on a Stick configuration. The network consists of five devices: three PCs, a switch, and a router, forming a Local Area Network (LAN). The router operates at Layer 3 (IP addressing) and is connected to the switch at the Access Layer (Hierarchical Design Model).
